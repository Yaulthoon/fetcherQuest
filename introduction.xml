Fetcher Quest is a browser-based tabletop
game that takes the player through the world of Avalon.  For Lupin 
Fetcher, what starts as a simple request turns into an exhausting 
trek for the aspiring inventor. <br /> <br />

As you make your way across the board, you will encounter various 
events that you must overcome to continue your journey.  Many may 
have multiple solutions depending on the path you take and the items 
you acquire.  Only through careful navigation can Lupin Fetcher brave 
his journey. <br /> <br />

The game continues until Lupin finds and delivers the item requested by 
his client.  This is the beginning build of the game and content is 
subject to change.  Have fun and feel free to leave feedback as the game 
progresses.
