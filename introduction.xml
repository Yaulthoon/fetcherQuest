<!--Scene #0 Introduction-->
<scene>
Fetcher Quest is a browser-based tabletop
game that takes the player through the world of Avalon.  For Lupin 
Fetcher, what starts as a simple request turns into an exhausting 
trek for the aspiring inventor. <br /> <br />

As you make your way across the board, you will encounter various 
events that you must overcome to continue your journey.  Many may 
have multiple solutions depending on the path you take and the items 
you acquire.  Only through careful navigation can Lupin Fetcher brave 
his journey. <br /> <br />

The game continues until Lupin finds and delivers the item requested by 
his client.  This is the beginning build of the game and content is 
subject to change.  Have fun and feel free to leave feedback as the game 
progresses.

<!--Scene #1 Shopping Explanation-->
<scene>
Before setting out on the journey, it is important to stock up on supplies.  
You can purchase from the list of items available in each town.  This starting 
town of Beginner's Folly is a starting point for various adventuring guilds, 
so many of its supplies cater to novice adventurers.  While the initial trek is 
pretty safe, I would recommend purchasing some camping supplies at the very least.

<!--Scene #2 Leaving Town-->
<scene>
Alright, I am almost ready to set out on the journey.  Being used to the fetcher 
lifestyle, I know of the many perils and pitfalls of the traveler, but speaking 
with the various merchants and adventurers inside the local tavern before I depart
 could save me some trouble in my travels down the road.
