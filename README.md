# fetcherQuest
Single-player interactive boardgame.  This is being rewritten as an Angular project.  I'm leaving this here for my personal reference only.

##  **No longer being supported**

Fetcher Quest is a long-term project designed around HTML/CSS/Javascript/XML/Ajax.  I am currently working on building initial assets such as my XML files prior to adding the actual events in the game.  This will be updated as significant progress is made.  The game is not in a working build at the moment, but certain functions are already in place in a preliminary fashion.  Image files will not be included for the time being.
